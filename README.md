# Create Your Shop (Multi-Store Web App)
A backend system that allows users to create and manage their own online shops. Each user can sign up, create a shop with a name and logo, add and manage products, and share a unique shop link where customers can browse items, add to cart, and checkout with a “Thank you for shopping” confirmation.

## Overview
**Create Your Shop (Multi-Store Web App)** is designed as a scalable backend system that empowers users to own independent online stores within a shared platform.  
Each shop operates autonomously — allowing users to:
- Register and authenticate securely using JWT.
- Create and customize their shop details.
- Add, update, and delete products.
- Process and manage customer orders.
- View shop analytics and dashboard stats.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure registration and login using JWT
   - Each user can manage only their own shop

2. **Shop Management**
   - Create and update shops with name, logo, and description
   - Each shop has a unique shareable slug link

3. **Product Management**
   - Add, update, or delete products with image upload
   - Search and filter by category or name

4. **Customer Shopping**
   - Browse products, add/remove from cart
   - Checkout with confirmation message

5. **Order Management**
   - Shop owners can view, update, or track order status

6. **Customer Reviews**
   - Customers can leave feedback on products

7. **Dashboard & Analytics**
   - Total products, orders, revenue, and order breakdown

8. **Email Notifications**
   - Confirmation emails via Nodemailer

9. **Delivery Option (Optional)**
   - Capture delivery address or pickup preference during checkout
| **File Uploads** | Product and shop images handled via Multer. |
| **Security** | Password hashing with bcrypt, protected routes using JWT middleware. |

## Tech Stack
**Backend Framework:** Node.js, Express.js  
**Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)  
**Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token), bcrypt  
**File Uploads:** Multer  
**Environment Management:** dotenv  
**Development Tools:** Nodemon, Postman  
**Architecture:** MVC Pattern (Model–View–Controller)

## Project Architecture
This project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern with an additional **Service layer** for logic separation.
- **Controllers:** Handle requests, responses, and validation.  
- **Services:** Contain reusable business logic.  
- **Models:** Define MongoDB schemas using Mongoose.  
- **Routes:** Define API endpoints and middlewares.  
- **Middlewares:** Handle authentication, authorization, and error control.
- **Config** – Contains app configuration such as Multer setup and database connection.
This separation ensures cleaner code, easier debugging, and future scalability.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/create-your-shop.git
cd create-your-shop

### Step 2: Install dependencies

npm install


### Step 3: Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

.env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/createYourShop
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password

FROM_NAME=Create Your Shop

### Step 4: Start the development server

npm run dev

For production:

npm start

The app will run locally on:
`http://localhost:5000`

2. **Shop Creation:** Each authenticated user can create their own shop with a name, logo, and description.
3. **Product Management:** Shop owners add and manage products linked to their shop ID.
4. **Customer Interaction:** Customers browse a shop’s products, add to cart, and place orders.
5. **Dashboard Insights:** Shop owners get analytics on sales, revenue, and pending/completed orders.
